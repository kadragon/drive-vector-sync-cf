      Integrate Vite build output into Worker:

      1. Build Process
         - Add npm script to build frontend
         - Import Vite dist/ output into Worker
         - Bundle static assets as strings/modules

      2. Worker Routing
         - GET / -> serve index.html
         - GET /assets/* -> serve JS/CSS files
         - Keep existing /admin/* routes
         - Keep existing /health route

      3. Static File Serving
         - Correct Content-Type headers
         - Cache-Control headers for assets
         - ETag support for efficient caching

      4. Build Integration
         - Update wrangler.toml for frontend assets
         - CI/CD: build frontend before worker deploy
         - Development: vite dev server with API proxy

      5. CORS Configuration
         - Allow frontend dev server in development
         - Production: same-origin only
    test_refs:
      - TEST-web-dashboard-1
    notes: |
      Use esbuild or custom bundler to embed static files.
      Consider using Cloudflare R2 for large assets (future).
      For now, embed directly in Worker bundle.

      Testing:
      - Unit tests for React components (Vitest + Testing Library)
      - Integration tests for API hooks
      - E2E test for dashboard load and interaction

      - Add screenshots of dashboard
      - Document build process
      - Document local development setup (frontend + worker)
      - Add troubleshooting for frontend issues

      Ensure all acceptance tests from spec pass.
      Consider adding Playwright for E2E if needed.

    title: "Refactor folder structure: rename src/ to worker/"
    priority: 3
    status: pending
    dependencies:
      - TASK-032
    estimated_effort: 1.5 hours

      Refactor project folder structure for clarity:

      Current structure:
        drive-vector-sync-cf/
        ├── src/              # Worker backend (ambiguous name)
        ├── frontend/         # React app
        └── package.json

      Target structure:
        drive-vector-sync-cf/
        ├── worker/           # Worker backend (clear purpose)
        ├── frontend/         # React app
        └── package.json

      Steps:
      1. Rename src/ directory to worker/
      2. Update wrangler.toml:
         - Change main = "src/index.ts" → "worker/index.ts"
      3. Update tsconfig.json:
         - Change "include": ["src/**/*"] → ["worker/**/*"]
      4. Update all import paths:
         - Find all "from 'src/*'" → "from 'worker/*'"
         - Update relative imports in test files
      5. Update package.json scripts if needed
      6. Run all tests to verify (267 tests should pass)
      7. Update .gitignore if needed
      8. Update documentation references to src/

      Benefits:
      - Clear separation: worker/ = Cloudflare Workers, frontend/ = React
      - Better developer experience
      - Easier onboarding for new contributors
      - Consistent with industry practices

      Risk mitigation:
      - Run full test suite after refactor
      - Verify wrangler dev still works
      - Check all import paths resolved correctly

      Should be done before production deployment for clean structure.
