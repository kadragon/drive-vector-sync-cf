      Refactor project folder structure for clarity:

      Current structure:
        drive-vector-sync-cf/
        ├── src/              # Worker backend (ambiguous name)
        ├── frontend/         # React app
        └── package.json

      Target structure:
        drive-vector-sync-cf/
        ├── worker/           # Worker backend (clear purpose)
        ├── frontend/         # React app
        └── package.json

      Steps:
      1. Rename src/ directory to worker/
      2. Update wrangler.toml:
         - Change main = "src/index.ts" → "worker/index.ts"
      3. Update tsconfig.json:
         - Change "include": ["src/**/*"] → ["worker/**/*"]
      4. Update all import paths:
         - Find all "from 'src/*'" → "from 'worker/*'"
         - Update relative imports in test files
      5. Update package.json scripts if needed
      6. Run all tests to verify (267 tests should pass)
      7. Update .gitignore if needed
      8. Update documentation references to src/
    test_refs: []

      Benefits:
      - Clear separation: worker/ = Cloudflare Workers, frontend/ = React
      - Better developer experience
      - Easier onboarding for new contributors
      - Consistent with industry practices

      Risk mitigation:
      - Run full test suite after refactor
      - Verify wrangler dev still works
      - Check all import paths resolved correctly

      Should be done before production deployment for clean structure.
