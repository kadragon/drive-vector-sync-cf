    Resume production verification now that auth is live: validate /admin/status and
    /admin/resync with real auth, and observe scheduled cron at 17:00 UTC.
  test_refs:
    - TEST-deployment-1
    - TEST-deployment-2
    - TEST-deployment-3
    - TEST-deployment-4
  notes: |
    Continuing deployment validation; user reported 503 from /admin/status.
    Investigated via wrangler tail: repeated CPU limit exceeded on GET /admin/status.
    Implemented optional Drive file count fetch (disabled by default) to avoid heavy call.
    Pending deployment to production for verification.
