  description: |
    Deploy the Drive → Vectorize sync worker (including embedded dashboard)
    to the production Cloudflare Workers environment. Configure all secrets,
    KV namespaces, and Vectorize bindings, then verify admin APIs, dashboard,
    manual sync trigger, and scheduled cron execution end-to-end.
  test_refs:
    - TEST-deployment-1
    - TEST-deployment-2
    - TEST-deployment-3
    - TEST-deployment-4
  notes: |
    Resumed after dashboard tasks completed. Follow README deployment
    guide and SPEC-deployment-1 acceptance tests—priority on wrangler
    deploy, dashboard verification, manual sync dry-run, and cron logging.

# Latest completed task:
# - TASK-032: Web dashboard testing and documentation (SPEC-web-dashboard-1)
# Completed at: 2025-11-15T13:48:01Z
#
# Changes implemented:
# - Added dedicated Vitest suites for dashboard hooks/components (StatsCard, SyncStatusPanel,
#   charts, ActionButtons) covering TEST-web-dashboard-2~6.
# - Created README "Dashboard Monitoring" section with build/embed workflow, commands,
#   acceptance test mapping, and troubleshooting tips, plus docs/dashboard-preview.svg.
# - Documented `npm run build:frontend-assets` so wrangler dev/deploy always bundle the
#   latest frontend.
#
# Next priority (from backlog.yaml):
# 1. TASK-021: Production deployment (ACTIVE)
# 2. TASK-033: Refactor folder structure (rename src/ → worker/)
